  <h1>What is a Wiki?</h1>
  <h3>A wiki, most would say they are websites with editable information. The most used wiki (I think) is wikipedia.org. A wiki is much more than most would think, according to cft.vanderbilt.edu, a wiki is, "a collaborative tool that allows students to contribute and modify one or more pages of course related materials."</h3>
  <h1>How does copyright apply to themarketspace.thewildben.repl.co?</h1>
  <h3>Because of copyright, people who visit our website cannot copy things off of it without saying were they got it from (us, who got our info from others). They can't entirely copy the whole layout, backrounds, and/or the website in-and-of-itself. I'm the one who came up with the design and layout for it, it was my idea.</h3>
